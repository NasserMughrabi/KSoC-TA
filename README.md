# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

The TA Application web application currently has users/roles and has applications 
that can be created, viewed, delete, ect.

# Comments to Evaluators:

Nothing to make you aware of. Work stands for itself

# Assignment Specific Topics

File/Image Uploads - I decided not to implement uploading and saving images for the lack of time.


ModificationTracking add value to any database because the programmer does not have code something from scratch to
keep track of timestamps of data changes on the website and keeping timestamp of data changes is important 
for users/admins to filter data and users on the website. The way the ModificaitonTracking table works is before saving 
changes to database timestamp function is called which will fill a row/record in the table that is inherited by some 
other table which will use that data to display for users or for any other purpose.
